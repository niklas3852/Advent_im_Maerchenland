# Farytale-Bot

### Welcome!
This is a public fairytale Discord-Bot, built in node.js for users to submit stories via DMs to the bot.  ðŸ§š
After a review through your staff team, the bot will publish your content in a pre-defined channel.

I originally coded this bot for Marmeladenoma as a winter special in 2020 (https://discord.gg/marmeladenoma) but feel free to use it for your own projects as well! :D

If you have any questions feel free to contact me via discord: *Niklas#4871*


## Starting up
- In the config.json file you can change all parameters you need.
- The message.js file is mainly for the messages and sumissions, here you can change the custom replies from the bot.
- Just copy the path where you safed it. (If the file is a .zip file, you have to unzip it first)
- open your cmd and typie in there:
  cd <your path>

after you navigated to it, type in:
  npm i

that message should appear:
   audited x packages in 0.758s
   found 0 vulnerabilities
