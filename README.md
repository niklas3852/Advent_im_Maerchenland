# Farytale-Bot
Little farytale bot
This is a bot originally made for https://discord.gg/marmeladenoma but you can use it too :D

If you have any questions feel free to contact me via discord: Niklas#4871

In the config.json file you can change all parameters you need an in the message.js file you can change the messages for everything


Ok nice, but how do I start that thing?

Firstibale fill out the config.json. Everything should be relatively easy to understand

Just copy the path where you safed it. (If the file is a .zip file, you have to unzip it first)
open your cmd and typie in there:
  cd <your path>
after you navigated to it, type in:
  npm i
that message should appear:
   audited 8 packages in 0.758s
   found 0 vulnerabilities
in the end just type in:
  node .
  
  then your bot is online :D
