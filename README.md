# Farytale-Bot
Little farytale bot
NodeJS Discord bot for users to submit stories via DMs. I originally created it for Marmeladenoma as a winter special (https://discord.gg/marmeladenoma).
But feel free to use it for your own projects as well :D

If you have any questions feel free to contact me via discord: Niklas#4871

In the config.json file you can change all parameters you need.
The message.js file is mainly for the messages and sumissions, here you can change the custom replies from the bot.


## Starting up
- Fill out the required params in the config.json. Everything should be relatively easy to understand
- Just copy the path where you safed it. (If the file is a .zip file, you have to unzip it first)
- open your cmd and typie in there:
  cd <your path>

after you navigated to it, type in:
  npm i

that message should appear:
   audited x packages in 0.758s
   found 0 vulnerabilities

in the end just type in:
  node .
  
  then your bot is online :D
