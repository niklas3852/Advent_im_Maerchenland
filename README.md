# Fairytale-Bot

### Welcome!
This is a public fairytale Discord-Bot, built in node.js for users to submit stories via DMs to the bot.  ðŸ§š
After a review through your staff team, the bot will publish your content in a pre-defined channel.

I originally coded this bot for Marmeladenoma as a winter special in 2020 (https://discord.gg/marmeladenoma) but feel free to use it for your own projects as well! :D

## Starting up
- Download the folder from my github repo or clone it with **git clone**
- In the *config.json* file you can change all parameters you need.
- The *message.js* file is mainly for the messages and sumissions, here you can change the custom replies from the bot.
  
- Copy the path where you saved your project in. (If the file is a .zip file, you have to unzip it first)
- Open your favourite terminal and navigate to your project folder:
  **cd {your project-folder-path}**
- You should now be in your project folder. If thatÂ´s been successfull, you can install all required node dependencies using
  **npm i**
- Now you can start up your bot with **node.**

Have fun and stay healthy! ðŸ¤©
