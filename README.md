# Farytale-Bot
This is a public fairytale Discord-Bot, built in node.js for users to submit stories via DMs to the but. After a review through your staff team, the bot will publish your content in a pre-defined channel.
I originally created it for Marmeladenoma as a winter special (https://discord.gg/marmeladenoma) but feel free to use it for your own projects as well! :D

If you have any questions feel free to contact me via discord: *Niklas#4871*

In the config.json file you can change all parameters you need.
The message.js file is mainly for the messages and sumissions, here you can change the custom replies from the bot.


## Starting up
- Fill out the required params in the config.json. Everything should be relatively easy to understand
- Just copy the path where you safed it. (If the file is a .zip file, you have to unzip it first)
- open your cmd and typie in there:
  cd <your path>

after you navigated to it, type in:
  npm i

that message should appear:
   audited x packages in 0.758s
   found 0 vulnerabilities

in the end just type in:
  node .
  
  then your bot is online :D
