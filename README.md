# Farytale-Bot
Little farytale bot
NodeJS Discord bot for users to submit stories via DMs. Origninally created for https://discord.gg/marmeladenoma but you can use it too :D

If you have any questions feel free to contact me via discord: Niklas#4871

In the config.json file you can change all parameters you need as well as in the message.js file you can change the messages for everything


Ok nice, but how do I start that thing?

Firstibale fill out the config.json. Everything should be relatively easy to understand

Just copy the path where you safed it. (If the file is a .zip file, you have to unzip it first)

open your cmd and typie in there:
  cd <your path>

after you navigated to it, type in:
  npm i

that message should appear:
   audited x packages in 0.758s
   found 0 vulnerabilities

in the end just type in:
  node .
  
  then your bot is online :D
